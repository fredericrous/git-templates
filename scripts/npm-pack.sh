#
# `<artifact-dir>` is the directory the release workflow downloads into: one
# `amont-<version>-<target>.tar.gz` (or `.zip`) per target, exactly as
# `release.yaml`'s `Archive` step produced them. Nothing is compiled here — the
# bytes published to npm are the SAME bytes published to the GitHub release and
# checksummed in `SHA256SUMS`, which is the property that makes the npm path
# worth trusting at all.
#
# Publishing is a separate step on purpose (`npm publish` in the workflow, or by
# hand from `<out-dir>`), so the layout can be inspected — and `npm pack`ed —
# before anything irreversible happens. npm versions are immutable.
