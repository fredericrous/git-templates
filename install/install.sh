# This script deliberately does NOT turn any hooks on. It downloads a verified
# binary, puts it somewhere your shims can find it, and tells you what to run
# next. That restraint is the point: this project's posture is that nothing
# runs in a repository you did not ask, and an installer that quietly enabled
# hooks — or worse, set `init.templateDir` so every future clone got them —
# would contradict the guarantee on its first contact with your machine.
#
# POSIX sh, no bashisms, because the shims are POSIX sh for the same reason:
# this has to run wherever git does.
