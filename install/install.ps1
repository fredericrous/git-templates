.SYNOPSIS
    Install the amont binary on Windows. Nothing else.

.DESCRIPTION
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.ps1 | iex

    The counterpart to install/install.sh, which is POSIX sh and therefore
    reaches Windows only through Git Bash. This one runs in the PowerShell
    that ships with Windows, so `curl | sh` stops being the only documented
    path on a platform the hooks genuinely support and CI genuinely tests.

    Like its sibling it deliberately turns NOTHING on. It downloads a verified
    binary, puts it where the shims already look, and says what to run next.
    An installer that enabled hooks — or set init.templateDir so every future
    clone got them — would contradict the project's central promise on first
    contact with the machine.

.PARAMETER Version
    A specific release, e.g. "v1.0.0". Defaults to the latest.

.PARAMETER BinDir
    Where to put the executables. Defaults to $HOME\.local\bin, and not
    arbitrarily: that is candidate 3 in the shim's own resolution order, and
    the shim tries both `amont` and `amont.exe` there — so a binary in
    that directory is found even by a shim whose path was never baked.
