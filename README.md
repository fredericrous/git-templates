# Git Templates with hooks

Git Starter Template with Simple hooks for your development workflow.

Here to inspire you create the git hooks that fit you

*If there is an issue with a hook, please open an issue and consult the section [Opt Out](#opt-out).*

Want to start right away? Check the [Requirements](#requirements) and head to the section [Setup](#setup).

## The workflow

You are working on a badass feature. Now's the time to share your work.
You hit `git commit`, a nice template `message` appears to help you write a meaningful log description.
Or maybe you are lazy and just write `git commit -m"Add to Cart"`.

### Pre-commit

Git triggers the `pre-commit` hook before the commit actually occurs. The hook calls in parallel all the scripts prefixed with `pre-commit-`. These scripts check the staged files for code that shouldn't be commited as is and more, see section [Hooks implemented](#hooks-implemented).

If one check fail, the commit is aborted.

Once the tests have passed, the next hook is triggered, `commit-msg`.

### Commit-msg

This hook lints your message, to help to keep some conventions in place, and it happens an emoji to your commit.

Here are the conventions the hooks from this repository takes inspiration from:

- <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit>
- <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>
- <https://gitmoji.dev/>

Once the message complies with the checks, the commit is finally created.

### Pre-push

When you run the command `git push`, the hook `pre-push` gets triggered. All the scripts prefixed with `pre-push` get executed in sequence. See section [Hooks implemented](#hooks-implemented).

Some of the hooks give you recommendation to help you resolve the branch state you are in

## Requirements

- Git 2.22+
- ZSH
- NodeJS (minimum v6)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/)

## Setup

Clone the repository to a convenient place:

```sh
mkdir ~/.config/git
cd ~/.config/git
git clone https://github.com/fredericrous/git-templates.git
chmod +x templates/hooks/*
```

Setup your gitconfig

```sh
git config --global init.templatedir ~/.config/git/git-templates/templates
git config --global commit.template ~/.config/git/git-templates/message
```

Copy the hooks to existing repositories

```sh
cd <folder-of-your-repo>
git init
```

## Hooks implemented

| hook | description |
|-|-|
| commit-msg | Lint commit message to conform to [git recommentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) and mostly to[conventional commits]( https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification<br>Prefix with an emoji conform to [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) specification<br>Apply formating to the commit: break the body to 72 char per line. It groups footers. It insures the body is separated by a blank line after the summary and before the footers |
| prepare-commit-msg | Extract Jira or Kanbanize id from branch name if there is, and append it to the footer of the commit msg |
| pre-commit-ban-terms | prevent the commit of certain tokens |
| pre-commit-lint-js | eslint js files in staging |
| pre-commit-lint-json-yaml | lint json and yaml with [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) |
| pre-commit-merge-conflict | detect for staged files in a merge states |
| pre-commit-package-lock | when a package.json is changed, check package-lock.json is versioned as well
| pre-commit-usual-name | Issue a warning when you use a commit user for the first time |
| pre-push-branch-pattern | insure a branch follows pattern `prefix/digit-branch-name`. ie `feat/3002-image-crop` |
| pre-push-force-same-branch | should test that when you do a force push, your target the same remote branch and avoid the default one |
| pre-push-pull-rebase | pull the origin remote branch with the same name before push. Fetch default branch and warn if it's ahead |

## Commit Prefix

```sh
# Uncomment one of the following templates
#üë∑   build:

#üîß   chore:
# ‚îî Changes to the configuration files or auxiliary tools and libraries
#    such as documentation generation
#üîß   chore(deps):
# ‚îî Upgrade or Downgrade a dependency
#üîß   chore(security):
# ‚îî Fix security issues
#üìù   docs:
# ‚îî Documentation only changes
#‚ú®   feat:
# ‚îî Introduce new features
#üêõ   fix:
# ‚îî Fix a bug
#‚ö°Ô∏è   perf:
# ‚îî Improves performance
#‚ôªÔ∏è  refactor:
# ‚îî A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#‚è™Ô∏è   revert:
# ‚îî Revert changes. Ideally done with the `git revert` command
#üé®   style:
# ‚îî Improve structure / format of the code
#üö®   test(tdd):
# ‚îî Add a failing test
#üö®   test:
# ‚îî Add, update, or pass tests
#‚ûï    add:
# ‚îî Add files as part of a larger feature
#‚ûñ    remove:
# ‚îî opposite of add:
```

## Update

Update the local clone to the latest version

```sh
cd ~/.config/git/git-templates/templates
git pull
```

Update the target repository

```sh
rm $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/*
git init
```

## Opt Out

**Bypass one `pre-push` or `pre-commit` hook**

You can use the flag `-c hook.skip=<name of hook>` to disable temporarely one hook. You can cumulate the `-c` flags to skip more hooks.

`<name of hook>` works as a glob pattern. For example `-c hook.skip=lint` would match `pre-commit-lint-js` and `pre-commit-lint-json-yaml`.

You can set the flag permanently for the repository with `git config --add hook.skip <name of hook>`

**Bypass all hooks on `pre-push` or `pre-commit`**

Append the option `--no-verify` to your `git push` or `git commit` command

Note: the prepare-commit-msg and commit-msg hooks can't be bypassed this way

**Warn instead of fail the commit**

If you like having the warning but would prefer the commit or push not to fail, replace the line `exit $EXIT_CODE` in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` by `break` or just remove the line.

**Uninstall**

You can disable the hooks any time by removing the files in `$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/`.

## Other ideas of hook not implemented

- post-commit: tag automatically when package version has been incremented (might be armful depending on your CD workflow)
- pre-commit: lint more languages
- pre-commit: check other languages Gemfile.lock, Pipfile.lock, Cargo.lock, composer.lock
- pre-commit: check you are commiting with the usual gpg key (could be slow)
- pre-push: check branch pattern for jira id
- pre-push: prevent force push to a remote branch that has a different name (amolst impossible?)
- commit-msg: commit msg alias. exemple: "."="(prev prefix): more on $(previous commit msg)"
- commit-msg: force user to put a description that contains more than 3 words and a body that contains more than 5 words

Note: Functionallities that are covered by gitattributes and gitignore shouldn't be implemented as hooks.

## A word about hook managers

A note on hook managers. Below is a list. Each has advantages and flows. Some have prebuilt hooks that the others don't.
The approach here is not to try to create a new challenger.
But to suggest a different approach, keep it simple with a template that is easy to modify.
You don't have zsh? convert the script to bash or powershell. You don't have nodejs? don't use the *.js hooks, or find others that fit you.
