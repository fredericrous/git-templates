//! Run a pre-push check against what is being PUSHED.
//!
//! `rust-test` and `run-tests-js` take their file set from the pushed refs —
//! correct — and then run the suite with `current_dir` set to the developer's
//! working tree. So the suite can pass on an uncommitted fix, or fail on an
//! uncommitted experiment, and in neither case has it tested the commits being
//! pushed. Same gap as the pre-commit one, from the other end.
//!
//! ## Why not the stash
//!
//! Holding unstaged changes aside is the pre-commit answer, and it is the wrong
//! instrument here. A push is not a staging operation: the difference that
//! matters is not tree-versus-index but tree-versus-the-commit-you-are-sending,
//! and that includes everything staged-but-uncommitted too. Setting all of it
//! aside for the length of a test suite would leave the developer looking at a
//! tree that is not theirs for minutes at a time.
//!
//! ## What it costs, which is the whole question
//!
//! `git worktree add --detach <tip>` materialises the pushed commit somewhere
//! else and the suite runs there. The tree is untouched, and an interrupted run
//! leaves a worktree rather than a mangled checkout.
//!
//! The cost is real: a second checkout, and a build that cannot reuse the
//! primary tree's `target/` cache, so the first push after this lands is a cold
//! build. That is why it is opt-in — `git config amont.testPushedTree true`
//! — rather than the default. The default keeps today's behaviour and now SAYS
//! what it is testing, which was the actual bug: not that it used the tree, but
//! that nobody knew it did.
