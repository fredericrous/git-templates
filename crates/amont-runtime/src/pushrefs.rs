//! The refs git feeds `pre-push` on stdin, read ONCE and shared.
//!
//! git writes one line per ref being pushed:
//!
//! ```text
//! <local ref> <local oid> <remote ref> <remote oid>
//! ```
//!
//! This exists because stdin can only be consumed once. While checks were
//! separate processes with INHERITED stdin, whichever ran first drained it and
//! the rest saw EOF — silently. Two repos in the fleet had a custom
//! `pre-push-branch-protect.sh` whose `while read` loop sorted BEFORE
//! `pre-push-run-tests-js`, so the test gate received no refs and ran nothing.
//! Nobody noticed, because "no refs" and "nothing to test" look identical.
//!
//! Reading it in one place and lending the result to every check removes that
//! whole class of bug, and makes it impossible to reintroduce by adding a
//! second stdin reader.
