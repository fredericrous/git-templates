//! Whether this repository's `.amont.conf` may run.
//!
//! `.amont.conf` is committed, which is the point — a team shares a check by
//! committing it. The consequence is that cloning a repository and committing to
//! it would otherwise run commands that repository chose, and neither of those
//! acts is one anybody performs as a decision about trust. Reviewing a diff
//! before running it is; nothing asked for that.
//!
//! So the manifest is inert until somebody says otherwise, and the record is
//! keyed on the FILE'S CONTENT rather than its path: a `git pull` that adds a
//! command does not inherit the consent given to the file before it.
//!
//! ## Why `git hash-object` and not a hash of our own
//!
//! `amont` links no external crates (`scripts/check-no-deps.sh`), and the
//! only hash in `std` is `DefaultHasher` — SipHash with a fixed key, which is
//! not collision-resistant and would let a crafted manifest match a trusted
//! one's fingerprint. Writing SHA-256 by hand is a hundred lines nobody would
//! review as carefully as they should.
//!
//! `git` is already a hard dependency of every path in this binary, and
//! `git hash-object` is the identity git itself uses for content. It is SHA-1
//! (or SHA-256 in a repository configured for it), which is not a strong
//! guarantee against a determined attacker with a chosen-prefix collision — but
//! it is enormously better than SipHash, costs no dependency, and a user can
//! reproduce it by hand to check what they trusted:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ git hash-object --no-filters .amont.conf
//! ```
//!
//! `--no-filters` is not decoration. Without it git applies the clean filter
//! and eol conversion that the repository's own committed `.gitattributes`
//! asks for — so the repository would be choosing the transform its consent is
//! taken through, and two manifests this parser reads differently can be given
//! the same id. Consent is bound to the bytes we PARSE.
