//! pre-commit-ruff and pre-commit-pyright — the two Python hooks.
//!
//! Both are scoped: they only fire when the repo opts in (a ruff/pyright config
//! or the matching `[tool.*]` table), so a JS repo never pulls a Python tool.
//!
//! Both prefer the repo's PINNED tool over an ambient latest, in the same order
//! the shell versions established: `uv run --no-sync` (the lockfile-pinned one
//! CI runs) → the worktree's .venv → the MAIN worktree's .venv (a linked
//! worktree has none of its own) → PATH → uvx (unpinned LATEST, with a warning,
//! because it flags issues the CI-pinned version does not — phantom failures).

    // error" perfectly.
