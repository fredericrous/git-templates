//! commit-msg — validate the summary line and reformat the message.
//!
//! Validates: a subject is present and within the subject limit; it carries a
//! conventional type prefix; a description follows, within the description
//! budget. Formats: place the type's gitmoji where the repository asked for it,
//! hard-wrap the body, and group the trailing footers with one blank line
//! before them.
//!
//! Every limit and the emoji placement are [`commit_style`] settings — four
//! `git config` keys with shipped defaults. What this hook enforces is
//! configurable; **that** it enforces is not.
//!
//! Two invariants hold across all four gitmoji placements:
//!
//! * **The limits measure what you wrote.** Decoration this hook added is
//!   removed before anything is counted, so the emoji can never eat the budget
//!   — and re-checking an already-decorated subject counts the same characters
//!   the author was told about the first time.
//! * **Re-running is a no-op.** `--amend`, a rebase reword and a `--no-verify`
//!   retry all hand this hook a subject it already wrote. See [`undecorate`].
//!
//! Ported from ~190 lines of JS. The one structural simplification is how the
//! optional leading emoji is recognised — see `split_leading_emoji`.
