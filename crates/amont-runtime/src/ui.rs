//! The signs the hooks print.
//!
//! **Colour is the terminal's decision, not ours.** These used to be 256-colour
//! codes — `38;5;112`, `38;5;160`, `38;5;208` — which live in the fixed xterm
//! cube. A terminal theme remaps only indices 0–15; anything above renders
//! identically whatever palette the user chose. So a carefully themed terminal
//! was being overridden by three numbers picked years ago.
//!
//! The base ANSI colours ARE theme-controlled, so `32` means "whatever this
//! terminal calls green". That is the whole fix: output follows a `vivid`
//! palette, a Solarized profile or a high-contrast one, without reading any
//! configuration.
//!
//! `LS_COLORS` is deliberately NOT consulted. It maps FILE TYPES — `di`, `ex`,
//! `mi` — while this output needs ok/warning/error. There is no honest
//! correspondence, and the nearest candidates are worse than nothing: under
//! `vivid lava`, `mi` and `or` are dark grey on red, which as a foreground for
//! `✗` is close to invisible.
//!
//! The earlier note here said the signs were "kept byte-identical" with the zsh
//! originals so a user could not tell which implementation ran. That mattered
//! during the migration and no longer does — no zsh hook remains to match.
