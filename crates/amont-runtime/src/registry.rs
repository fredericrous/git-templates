//! The hook registry — one table, one signature.
//!
//! Before this, dispatch was a 20-arm `match` in main.rs and handlers had four
//! different signatures (`run(&args)`, `run(&hook, &args)`, `argo_lint(&args)`,
//! …). Two costs, one of them real:
//!
//!   - adding a hook meant touching a match arm, a module, and remembering
//!     which signature that one used;
//!   - the hook NAME was written twice — in the arm and as the shim's filename
//!     — with nothing checking they agree. A shim the binary does not recognise
//!     exits 2 and blocks the commit; a handler with no shim is dead code. The
//!     consistency test below turns that pairing into something enforced.
