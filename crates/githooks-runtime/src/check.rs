//! What a check IS, as one value rather than four tables.
//!
//! Before this, a check was spread across `REGISTRY` (name → fn), two ordered
//! name lists, and a language table in the fleet crate — four places keyed by
//! the same string, held together by reconciliation tests. Those tests were
//! good, but they policed a shape that should not have been splittable. With
//! the metadata attached to the check, there is nothing left to reconcile.
//!
//! It also gives external checks somewhere to exist. A third party cannot add a
//! Rust module without rebuilding the binary, so extension means a declared
//! command implementing this same trait — and the dispatcher not caring which
//! kind it is holding.
