//! The git-templates hook logic: registry, dispatchers and every check.
//!
//! This is a library so that more than one binary can hold the same truth about
//! what a hook IS. `githooks` (the commit path) executes the checks;
//! `githooks-fleet` reports on how they are installed across the fleet. Before
//! the split there was no lib target at all, which is why `cargo test --lib`
//! failed outright.
//!
//! **This crate must never gain an external dependency.** The hook binary
//! depends on it, so anything added here reaches every commit transitively —
//! and the entire Rust migration existed to remove exactly that kind of
//! requirement. ratatui and friends belong in `githooks-fleet`.
//!
//! Hooks are invoked through a thin `sh` shim at each hook path, which passes
//! the hooks directory it lives in:
//!
//! ```text
//! githooks --hooks-dir <dir> pre-commit [args…]
//! ```
