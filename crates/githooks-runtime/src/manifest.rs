//! `.githooks.conf` — checks a repository declares for itself.
//!
//! A third party cannot add a Rust module without rebuilding this binary, so
//! extension means declared commands.
//!
//! The manifest is **committed at the repository root**, and that is the point.
//! `.git/hooks` is not committed, so under the old filename-prefix mechanism a
//! team could never actually share a custom hook — every member had to install
//! it by hand, and nothing told them when it changed. That flaw mattered more
//! than the lexicographic ordering usually cited against prefixes.
//!
//! ```text
//! # stage       name        scope   severity  command
//! pre-commit    shellcheck  *.sh    block     scripts/lint-shell.sh
//! pre-push      smoke       *       warn      make smoke
//! ```
//!
//! Whitespace-delimited, in file order. TOML would be nicer to write and costs a
//! dependency tree that would then run on every commit in ninety-six
//! repositories; for four fields and a command, the twenty lines of parsing win.
//! See `scripts/check-no-deps.sh` for why that trade is the default here.
//!
//! ## No shell
//!
//! The command is split on whitespace and executed directly. There is no shell,
//! so no pipes, no redirection, no globbing and no quoting. Two reasons, and the
//! second is the one that decided it: Windows has no `sh`, and every emulation
//! of one this project has tried has been a source of bugs; and a manifest line
//! that silently gained shell semantics would be a much larger thing to have
//! introduced than it looks. A pipeline belongs in a script the line invokes.
//!
//! ## A line that cannot be understood is not skipped
//!
//! A malformed line means a check the repository asked for is not running, which
//! is precisely the "looks verified, enforced nothing" failure `Outcome` exists
//! to name. So a broken line still produces a check — one that runs to
//! `Unavailable` and says why. It appears in the dispatcher's "could not run"
//! roll-up like any other gap, rather than needing a mechanism of its own.
