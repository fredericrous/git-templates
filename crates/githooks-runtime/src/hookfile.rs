//! The single owner of every "is this file ours, and may we touch it?" answer.
//!
//! Three separate places used to answer that question, each with its own
//! one-liner, and every one of them failed OPEN — an error, an odd file type or
//! a git that would not answer all collapsed into `false`, and `false` meant
//! "not foreign", which meant "go ahead and overwrite it". The three:
//!
//! ```text
//! install::foreign_hooks   read_to_string(..).map(|t| !is_our_shim(&t)).unwrap_or(false)
//! fleet::scan::is_ours     read_to_string(..).map(|s| is_our_shim(&s)).unwrap_or(false)
//! fleet::fix::plan         read_to_string(..).map(|t| !is_our_shim(&t)).unwrap_or(false)
//! ```
//!
//! `read_to_string` fails on any file that is not valid UTF-8. A compiled hook
//! — somebody's Go binary at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, which is a perfectly
//! ordinary thing to have — reads back `Err(InvalidData)`, and `unwrap_or(false)`
//! turned that into "not foreign". `githooks install` then wrote a shim straight
//! over it, with no `--force`, no refusal, and no message. That is the same
//! class of failure as the two incidents that overwrote tracked source files,
//! and it had no guard at all.
//!
//! So everything here fails CLOSED. When this module cannot establish that a
//! path is ours and safe, it says so with a reason, and the caller refuses.
//! Refusing is cheap; the alternative has destroyed somebody's work three times.
//!
//! ## Why the LINK is the thing, never its target
//!
//! `std::fs::write` and `std::fs::OpenOptions` FOLLOW symlinks: opening
//! `.git/hooks/pre-commit` when that is a link to `../../devhooks/pre-commit`
//! truncates and rewrites `devhooks/pre-commit`, a tracked file in the working
//! tree. That is the verified bug this module exists to end: the guard checked
//! the link path — untracked, in `.git`, nothing alarming about it — and the
//! write landed somewhere else entirely.
//!
//! `std::fs::rename` does NOT follow symlinks; it replaces the link. So every
//! write in this module is staged to a sibling temporary file and renamed into
//! place. `--force` on a symlinked hook therefore means "replace the link", and
//! the file it pointed at is never opened at all. There is no code path here
//! that writes through a link, which is a stronger statement than "we check
//! first" — a check can be raced, and this cannot.
//!
//! ## Windows
//!
//! - A junction and a directory symlink both report `is_symlink()` from
//!   `symlink_metadata`, so the symlink refusal covers them. Ordinary users
//!   cannot create file symlinks without Developer Mode, which is why the
//!   symlink tests are `#[cfg(unix)]` — the CODE is not.
//! - `fs::rename` over a file another process has open fails on Windows where
//!   it would succeed on unix. That failure is REPORTED (`SwapFailure` names
//!   the path and the io error) rather than swallowed, because a hook that was
//!   not written is exactly what the caller must be told about.
//! - `nlink` is unix-only. The multiply-linked refusal below is `#[cfg(unix)]`;
//!   Windows hard links exist but std exposes no count, so that particular
//!   check simply is not made there. Every other guard applies on both.
