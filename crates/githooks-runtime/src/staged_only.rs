//! Make the checks see what is being committed.
//!
//! `staged_files()` asks the index for the PATH LIST, which is right, and then
//! hands those paths to tools that open them from the WORKING TREE. Eleven of
//! the fifteen pre-commit checks do this. So `git add -p` half a file, commit,
//! and prettier reads the whole working-tree file: it fails on lines you did not
//! stage, or passes on lines you did.
//!
//! `pre-commit` fixes this for everyone by stashing the unstaged changes for the
//! duration of the run, and their wording names both directions:
//!
//! > Running hooks on unstaged changes can lead to both false-positives and
//! > false-negatives during committing.
//!
//! ## This is the most dangerous code in the repository
//!
//! A stash taken and not restored loses uncommitted work. That is worse than
//! either failure that overwrote tracked files, because there is nothing on disk
//! to recover from. Hence, in order of how likely each is to bite:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing to stash → nothing happens.** The common case never touches the
//!    tree.
//! 2. **Restore on a SIGNAL.** `Drop` runs on unwind and on early return; it
//!    does NOT run when Ctrl-C kills the process, and interrupting a slow
//!    pre-commit is the most probable route to an orphaned stash, not the least.
//! 3. **Restore in `Drop`** for panics and early returns.
//! 4. **Never mid-operation.** A merge or rebase in progress means the tree is
//!    already holding somebody else's work — `GitState` (PR 2) answers this.
//! 5. **Restore failure is loud and fatal**, and prints the store's path, so
//!    the work is findable on disk rather than silently gone. (Not `git stash
//!    list`: nothing here is a stash ref — see the `impl` comment below for
//!    why byte-exact copies beat both `stash --keep-index` and a patch.)
//! 6. **`githooks restore`** for when even the handler was interrupted.
//!
//! The store describes itself in an `index` file, and every repo-controlled
//! path lives under `files/`. Both because the store used to encode its
//! metadata in the payload FILENAMES, which a repository is allowed to collide
//! with — and did, deleting a tracked file and planting a symlink outside the
//! worktree. See [`Held`].
