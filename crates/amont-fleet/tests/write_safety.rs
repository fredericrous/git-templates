//! What `amont-fleet` is willing to write over, driven through the real
//! binary.
//!
//! Every case here is one where the tool used to write and now refuses, and all
//! of them share a shape: the guard was asked about the path it was HANDED
//! rather than about the file that would actually be changed.
//!
//! - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is a symlink into the working tree. The link is
//!   untracked, sits in `.git`, and has nothing alarming about it — so the
//!   tracked guard said yes and `std::fs::write` followed the link and rewrote
//!   a tracked file. Verified: `fix --apply` reported `4 written` and left four
//!   tracked files modified.
//! - git cannot answer whether a path is tracked (`fatal: detected dubious
//!   ownership`, i.e. every repository owned by another uid, i.e. every repo
//!   inside a container bind mount) and the predicate turned that into "not
//!   tracked".
//!
//! The two `plan`-then-apply RACE cases — a repo that stopped being managed,
//! and a dispatcher that became foreign — are unit tests in `src/apply.rs`
//! instead, and deliberately: `fix --apply` computes and applies in one breath,
//! so nothing outside the process can open that window. A CLI-driven version
//! would only prove that the planner and `apply` agree, which is exactly the
//! assumption that let `apply` skip four of its five re-checks for two
//! releases.
