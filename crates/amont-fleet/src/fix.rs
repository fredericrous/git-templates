//! What it would take to bring one repository back to the shipped state.
//!
//! A plan, never an action. PR 5 executes exactly this structure; nothing here
//! touches the filesystem, which is what makes the parity differential against
//! `propagate.sh` meaningful — two implementations can be compared before
//! either is trusted to delete anything.
//!
//! The refusals are the important half. `make install` destroyed tracked source
//! twice in this repo's history, both times because its guard FAILED OPEN:
//! anything it could not confirm became safe to delete. So a plan refuses on
//! anything it cannot positively establish, and a refusal suppresses the whole
//! repo rather than the individual file — a half-applied fix is how a repo ends
//! up with both `pre-commit-ruff.zsh` and `pre-commit-ruff`, running ruff twice.
//!
//! ## Where "is this ours, and may we touch it?" is answered
//!
//! Not here. [`amont_runtime::hookfile`] owns every one of those questions —
//! ownership, tracked-ness, symlinks, file type — and this module only turns its
//! answers into refusals.
//!
//! That module exists because this one used to answer them itself, and got both
//! halves wrong in the same three lines:
//!
//! ```text
//! Command::new("git").args(["ls-files", "--error-unmatch"]).arg(path)   // ABSOLUTE path
//!     .current_dir(dir).output().map(|o| o.status.success()).unwrap_or(false)
//! ```
//!
//! - git normalises a pathspec LEXICALLY but resolves its working directory
//!   PHYSICALLY, so handing it the absolute `<repo>/.git/hooks/pre-commit` when
//!   `.git/hooks` is a symlink into the working tree returns `exit 1, pathspec
//!   did not match` — "untracked" — for a file git plainly tracks. That is the
//!   exact shape of both incidents this guard was written for.
//! - `.map(|o| o.status.success()).unwrap_or(false)` collapsed a spawn failure,
//!   a `fatal: detected dubious ownership` (every repo owned by another uid,
//!   which is every repo inside a container bind mount) and a permissions error
//!   into the same "untracked" — the opposite of the rule this module's own doc
//!   states two paragraphs up.
//!
//! `hookfile::tracked` asks with the BASENAME from `-C <parent>` and answers
//! tri-state, so "could not tell" is its own refusal ([`Refusal::TrackedUnknown`])
//! rather than a clean "no".
