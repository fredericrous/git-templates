//! Executing a `FixPlan`. The only code here that deletes anything.
//!
//! Three rules, each bought with an incident:
//!
//! 1. **Re-plan, never trust a stale plan.** The caller shows a preview and the
//!    user confirms; between those moments the tree can change. Applying the
//!    plan that was displayed would act on a world that no longer exists, so
//!    apply takes the plan it just computed and verifies its refusals again.
//!
//! 2. **A refusal suppresses the whole repository.** Not the offending file —
//!    the repo. A half-applied fix is precisely how a repo ends up holding both
//!    `pre-commit-ruff.zsh` and `pre-commit-ruff`, running ruff twice, silently,
//!    on whichever repos a loop happened to reach.
//!
//! 3. **Remove before write, and stop the repo on the first error.** Writing
//!    first would leave the retired file next to its replacement, which is the
//!    double-run state again.
//!
//! `make install` destroyed tracked source twice in this repo's history, both
//! times because its guard failed OPEN. Nothing here deletes a path it has not
//! positively established is safe.
//!
//! ## Rule 1 was a claim, not a fact
//!
//! For two releases the doc above said "verifies its refusals again" and only
//! ONE of the five was re-checked. `Unmanaged`, `ForeignHook` and the hooks
//! directory's location were all taken on trust from a plan built before the
//! user was even shown a preview, and the write itself went through
//! `std::fs::write`, which FOLLOWS SYMLINKS.
//!
//! The verified consequence: a repository with four tracked dispatchers under
//! `shared/` and `.git/hooks/*` symlinked to them. `fix --apply` reported
//! `4 written` and left all four TRACKED FILES MODIFIED. The plan's own
//! symlink guard had never been asked, and the one guard that did run — the
//! tracked check — was asking about the link, which is untracked, sits in
//! `.git`, and has nothing alarming about it.
//!
//! So every write and every remove now goes through
//! [`amont_runtime::hookfile`], which is the single owner of "is this ours,
//! and may we touch it?" — it never follows a link, never guesses, and stages
//! every write to a sibling temporary that is `rename`d into place, so
//! REPLACING a link is the only thing that can happen and writing THROUGH one
//! is not a code path that exists. That is a stronger statement than "we check
//! first", because a check can be raced and this cannot.
//!
//! Deleting `write_executable` in favour of `hookfile::stage` + `commit_all`
//! also strengthens `written_shims_are_executable`: the mode is set on the
//! temporary before the rename, so the file is never visible at its
//! destination in a non-executable state — where git would silently not run it.
