  install        turn hooks on across the root

  fix            show what would be changed — DRY RUN unless --apply
  fix --apply    carry out the plan

  --root <dir>   where to look for repositories (default: $HOME/Developer)
  --depth <n>    directory levels to descend  (default: 6)
  --binary <p>   the binary shims should point at (default: $HOME/.local/bin/amont)
  --agents-md    with fix/install: also roll out the AGENTS.md pointer
  --remove-unrecognized
                 ALSO delete pre-commit-* / pre-push-* files this tool did not
                 write. Off by default, and read the sentence below first.
  --json         emit the result as JSON

install and fix --apply never delete a hook they did not write: a
pre-commit-* or pre-push-* file without our marker is reported and left
exactly where it is.
