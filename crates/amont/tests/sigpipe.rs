//! `amont list | head` must die quietly, like every other Unix filter.
//!
//! Rust ignores SIGPIPE at startup, so the first `head` that closed the pipe
//! early turned `list` into a panic with a full backtrace — "failed printing
//! to stdout: Broken pipe" — which reads as a crash in a tool whose whole
//! claim is composure. `main` restores SIGPIPE's default disposition; this
//! test is what stops that line being "simplified" away.
//!
//! Unix-only by nature: Windows has no SIGPIPE, and there the closed-pipe
//! write comes back as an `Err` instead of a signal.
