//! How the shim finds the binary — driven through a real `sh`.
//!
//! The shim is the one piece of this project that is not Rust, and it is the
//! piece that runs first, in every repository, before any check and before any
//! trust decision. So these tests execute the actual file with `sh` rather than
//! asserting anything about its text.
//!
//! The case they exist for: git invokes a hook with the WORKING TREE as the
//! current directory, so a relative path in the resolution chain is a question
//! asked of the repository being committed to. An unbaked shim — a supported,
//! documented state, since `init.templateDir` pointed at the checkout keeps the
//! placeholder on purpose — used to test that token with `[ -x ]`, which meant
//! a cloned repository shipping an executable by that name answered it.
