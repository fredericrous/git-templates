//! A guard for prose no compiler reads.
//!
//! "Twenty checks" is load-bearing copy: it appears on the README's first
//! screen, on the docs landing page, at the top of the checks reference and in
//! the comparison table — the four pages a prospective user actually reads.
//! Nothing ties that word to `registry::CHECKS`, so the twenty-first check
//! would ship with every page quietly understating the count. Same shape as
//! `release_profile.rs`: the only place the question can be asked is the file
//! itself, found relative to this crate rather than to the process's working
//! directory.
//!
//! Design records are deliberately not checked — they are dated records of a
//! decision, and "the 20 checks of the day" in one of them is history, not a
//! claim about the present.
