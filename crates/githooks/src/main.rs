//! The hook binary — argument handling only.
//!
//! Everything it does lives in `githooks-runtime`. Git invokes exactly four
//! hook names; the shim passes its own filename through, and the registry maps
//! that name to a handler.
//!
//! ## Why the parsing is one total function
//!
//! This file used to walk the arguments with an ad-hoc loop that took the first
//! non-flag token as the hook name and swept everything after it into `rest` —
//! and then asked, seven times over, `rest.first() == "install"`,
//! `rest.first() == "run"`, and so on. `rest` is where GIT'S OWN ARGUMENTS to
//! the hook live.
//!
//! So `githooks --hooks-dir d pre-push <remote> <url>`, which is exactly what
//! the pre-push shim execs, dispatched on the REMOTE NAME. A remote called
//! `install` ran the full installer — copying the binary, populating the
//! template directory, baking shims — in the middle of a push. A remote called
//! `run`, `list`, `trust`, `restore` or `uninstall` was worse in the quiet way:
//! the branch fired, did something unrelated or nothing at all, and exited 0.
//! A push with zero checks, reported as a pass. `git remote add install <url>`
//! is a strange thing to type but not an impossible one, and nothing in the
//! shim, the hook, or the output would have hinted at the cause.
//!
//! The rule that fixes it is one line long: **only position 0 is ever tested
//! against the subcommand table.** Everything after it is data. That is not
//! something a reader can verify by scanning a chain of `if`s, so the parse is
//! a single function returning an [`Invocation`], and the property is a test
//! (`a_hook_argument_never_names_a_subcommand`) over every spelling the table
//! holds.
