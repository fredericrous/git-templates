//! What the trust prompt shows is what gets trusted.
//!
//! `githooks trust` prints a repository's declarations so a person can read
//! them before accepting. The names and commands in that listing are chosen by
//! whoever wrote the repository, and they were printed verbatim — so a
//! declaration whose name began with `\x1b[8m` (conceal) HID THE NEXT ONE.
//! The reader saw two declarations, pressed y, and got three.
//!
//! Nothing about the trust model was bypassed: the fingerprint still covered
//! every byte, the gate still ran. The rendering lied about what was being
//! accepted, which reaches the same place by a shorter route — and unlike a
//! race, it is not even timing-dependent.
