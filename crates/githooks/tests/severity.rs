//! Severity: a check that fails without failing the commit.
//!
//! `hook.skip` already existed for "do not run this". Severity is the opposite
//! trade: keep running it, keep reading its output, stop treating its verdict as
//! fatal. The distinction is worth pinning because the cheap implementation of
//! "make it non-blocking" is to skip it, and that silently deletes the signal
//! everyone thought they were keeping.
