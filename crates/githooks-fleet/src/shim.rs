//! Classifying an installed hook file against what it should be.
//!
//! The trap here is symmetrical and both halves are silent:
//!
//! - Compare an installed shim against the RAW tracked template and every one
//!   of the 96 repos reports as drifted, because installation deliberately
//!   substitutes the binary path. A tool that cries wolf on the whole fleet is
//!   a tool nobody reads.
//! - Compare too loosely — say, on length or on one marker line — and genuine
//!   drift is never seen, which is worse, because the report still looks calm.
//!
//! So classification is exact: recover the baked path from the installed file,
//! re-render the template with it, and require byte equality. Recovery IS the
//! comparison; there is no fuzzy middle.
//!
//! Note the placeholder appears three times in the template, one of them inside
//! a comment, because `make install` seds globally. Any comparison that assumed
//! a single substitution would misclassify every baked shim.
