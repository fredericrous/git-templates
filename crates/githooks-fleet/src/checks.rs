//! Answers the question the old text output could not: *where does
//! `pre-commit-pyright` actually run?* That one was installed in 6 of 96 repos
//! by historical accident rather than decision, and nothing made that visible.
//!
//! **Applicability here is an approximation, and the UI must never turn it into
//! a verdict.** The hooks themselves scope on the STAGED FILES of a particular
//! commit and on the nearest ancestor manifest; this reasons from manifests at
//! the repo root. A repo with Rust in a subdirectory shows no `rust` and will
//! still run clippy when you touch it. The column answers "would this ever
//! fire here", not "will it fire now".
//!
//! The distinction that must not blur is inert vs failing. `pre-commit-clippy`
//! in a Python repo is CORRECTLY silent; rendering that the same way as a
//! broken hook would manufacture ninety false problems out of the Rust checks
//! alone.
