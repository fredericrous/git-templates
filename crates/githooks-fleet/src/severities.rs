//! Reading `githooks.severity.<check>`, the quieter cousin of `hook.skip`.
//!
//! A skip is at least honest about itself: the check does not run, the
//! dispatcher says so on every commit, and the dashboard counts it. A severity
//! downgrade leaves everything looking normal — the check runs, prints its
//! failure in red, and the commit sails through. Read the terminal and you see
//! a hook doing its job. Read the exit code and it enforced nothing.
//!
//! That gap is the whole reason this module exists. A repo with six downgraded
//! checks and a repo with none are indistinguishable in every column the
//! dashboard had before, and the six-downgrade repo is the one worth knowing
//! about.
//!
//! Read-only, like `skips` was at first. Toggling severity from the UI is a
//! later change; being able to SEE it does not have to wait for that.
