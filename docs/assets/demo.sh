# Drives the README demo. Everything here is REAL: a real repository, the real
# release binary, real hook output, recorded in one pass. Nothing is re-enacted,
# and nothing is edited afterwards — which is the point, since the thing being
# demonstrated is that these checks behave the way the README says they do.
#
# To re-record (needs `asciinema` and `agg`):
#
#     cargo build --release
#     rm -rf /tmp/shop /tmp/shop-home
#     mkdir -p /tmp/shop-home/.local/bin /tmp/shop
#     cp target/release/amont /tmp/shop-home/.local/bin/amont

# The isolated HOME/XDG/GIT_CONFIG_* environment is not tidiness. Without it the
# recording prints the recorder's own checkout paths and their global
# `init.templateDir` — noise, and somebody's directory layout published to
# strangers.
#
# `amont install` runs BEFORE the recording rather than inside it: it prompts
# about AGENTS.md on a tty, and a demo that hangs waiting for a keypress records
# the hang.
