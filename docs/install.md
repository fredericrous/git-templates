# Installing and activating

Two separate acts, and keeping them separate is deliberate. **Installing the
binary** puts a program on your machine. **Activating** turns hooks on in a
repository. Nothing about the first does the second.

## 1. Get the binary

Linux and macOS:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.sh | sh
```

Windows, in PowerShell — the line above is POSIX `sh`, so on Windows it runs
only under Git Bash:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer resolves the latest release, downloads the archive for your
platform, verifies it against the published `SHA256SUMS`, and writes the binary
to `$AMONT_BIN_DIR` (default `~/.local/bin`) by atomic rename, so a
half-copied `amont` never exists.

It refuses to guess. If the checksum does not match it exits rather than
installing; if `SHA256SUMS` is missing or there is no sha256 tool on the
machine it says loudly that the download was **not** verified rather than
staying quiet about it. Verifying what this binary is before putting it in a
position to read every staged file is the argument the project makes about its
own dependencies, applied to itself.

`~/.local/bin` is not an arbitrary default: it is a candidate in the shim's
own resolution order, so a binary there is found even by a shim whose baked
path is wrong — and it is the same convention systemd, pipx and uv observe.

### Where the binary ends up

`amont install` copies the running binary somewhere stable and bakes that
path into every shim it writes — **unless the binary is already on your
`PATH`**, in which case it bakes it where it is and copies nothing.

That split matters for package managers. `./target/release/amont install`
must copy, because `cargo clean` deletes that directory and the shims would
stop resolving. A binary from `brew install`, `cargo install` or a distro
package must **not** be copied: the copy is a second, unmanaged binary that the
package manager will never update again, so `brew upgrade amont` refreshes
one file while every repository stays baked to a frozen one. That is the same
staleness the copy exists to prevent, arrived at from the other side.

The path baked for a package-managed binary is the one **`PATH` exposes**, not
the resolved one. Homebrew's `/usr/local/bin/amont` is a symlink into
`/usr/local/Cellar/amont/<version>/bin/`, and that versioned directory is
deleted on the next upgrade — baking it would pin every repository to a path
about to stop existing. The same is true of nix, asdf and mise.

### Installing somewhere else

`$AMONT_BIN_DIR` moves the binary, and `install` bakes wherever it landed
into the shims it writes — so a custom location resolves through the baked path
and needs nothing further.

The exception is the setup where shims are deliberately left **unbaked**:
`init.templateDir` pointed at a checkout. Those shims resolve at run time from
`~/.local/bin`, which is a constant inside a POSIX `sh` file. Choose both and
they stop composing — nothing baked a path, and the one path the shims know is
not where the binary went. `amont install` says so when it sees the
combination, and offers the two ways out: link the binary where the shims look,
or set `$GIT_HOOKS_BIN`.

`$AMONT_BIN_DIR` is an install-time setting only; the shim never reads it.
The runtime override is `$GIT_HOOKS_BIN` — one variable able to redirect which
binary executes on every commit is enough surface.

Pin a version, or install elsewhere:

```sh
AMONT_VERSION=v1.0.0 AMONT_BIN_DIR=~/bin \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.sh | sh
```

### Without the installer

Download an archive and its checksum from
[Releases](https://github.com/fredericrous/amont/releases/latest). Prebuilt
targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

Or build it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fredericrous/amont.git
cd amont && cargo build --release
./target/release/amont install
```

Or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/amont), which builds the same
source:

```sh
cargo install amont
```

Or with Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap fredericrous/tap
brew trust fredericrous/tap
brew install amont
```

The `brew trust` line is Homebrew's policy for every tap outside its own core,
not something specific to this one — a formula is code, and Homebrew now asks
you to decide about running it explicitly. Which is the same argument this tool
makes about a repository's declared checks.

### As a project dependency (npm)

For a JavaScript project, the binary can travel with the repository instead of
with the machine:

```sh
npm i -D amont        # or: pnpm add -D amont
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="amont init"
npm install           # prepare runs; the hooks appear
```

Anyone who then clones the repository and runs `npm install` gets the hooks.
That is [§2](#2-turn-hooks-on) done for them, by the package manager, once —
which is the whole point of the shape.

Six prebuilt platform packages are declared as `optionalDependencies`
(`amont-darwin-arm64`, `amont-linux-x64-gnu`, …), each carrying `os`, `cpu` and
`libc`, so npm and pnpm install exactly one and skip the other five. **There is
no `postinstall`**, deliberately: `npm ci --ignore-scripts` is a normal
hardening choice, and a package that quietly installs nothing under it would
fail much later, as `amont: not found` from a git hook.

The `bin` npm links is a small JS shim, because a linked `bin` has to live
inside the package it belongs to. It is not on the hook path: `amont init`
bakes the **native** binary's path into `.git/hooks`, so node runs once during
`prepare` and never on a commit.

If your platform is not one of the six, `npm install` will succeed and the shim
will say so the first time it runs. `cargo install amont` builds the same
source anywhere Rust does.

#### `init` and `install` are different verbs

`amont init` wires up **one repository** and nothing else. It does not copy a
binary into `~/.local/bin`, does not touch `~/.config/git/git-templates`, and
never prompts — all three of which `install` does, and all three of which are
wrong for something that runs on every teammate's `npm install`. The trust
prompt is the sharp one: it reads `/dev/tty`, so in a terminal it would *block*,
and `npm install` would hang on a question about a manifest nobody has read.

Outside a git repository `init` exits 0 in silence, because `npm install`
legitimately runs from a tarball, inside a Docker build and in CI. It stays loud
about everything else.

#### If anything ever installs without your dev dependencies

`npm` runs `prepare` on `npm ci` too — including `npm ci --omit=dev`, which is
the usual second stage of a Dockerfile. `amont` is a **dev** dependency, so it
is not there, and `prepare` fails on a command that does not exist. The install
fails with it, and a broken image build is a confusing way to learn this.

Guard it the same way husky's own documentation does:

```json
"prepare": "amont init || true"
```

Only where you need it. A repository with no production-install path should
keep the bare `amont init`, so a real failure — a hook it may not overwrite, a
`core.hooksPath` another tool owns — is loud rather than swallowed. `|| true`
buys nothing there and hides something.

`init` already handles the *other* half of a Docker build on its own: the
builder stage has a `package.json` and no `.git`, which is the silent exit 0
above.

#### On turning hooks on from a package manager

[The installer](#1-get-the-binary) says, and means, that it does not turn any
hooks on. A `prepare` script plainly does. The two are not in tension, and the
distinction is worth stating rather than leaving to be reconciled:

- **the machine** still decides nothing implicitly. Installing this tool, by any
  route, activates nothing anywhere;
- **the repository** opts in, once, by committing a line to its own
  `package.json` — a reviewable change, in the open, that a reader can see;
- what arrives is still four legible files in `.git/hooks`. A colleague who has
  never heard of this tool can `cat .git/hooks/pre-commit` and see what runs,
  which is exactly the property that made us
  [refuse `core.hooksPath`](index-fidelity-and-run-modes.md#what-we-are-not-taking-and-why).

### Requirements

**Git 2.31+.** `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute` landed in 2.31, and three
places depend on it: `install.rs` resolving the hooks directory,
`hooks/common.rs` finding the git common dir, and `hooks/python_tools.rs`
locating a linked worktree's main `.venv`. On an older git those return nothing
rather than failing loudly, which is the worst possible shape for a version
floor — the tool appears to work and quietly resolves the wrong paths.

Nothing else. Each check brings its own tool requirement only where you have
opted into that check: a repository with no `ruff.toml` never needs ruff.

## 2. Turn hooks on

### Per repository — the default

```sh
cd <your-repo> && amont install
amont list                        # what would run here, and why not
```

That writes four shims into `.git/hooks` — `pre-commit`, `pre-push`,
`commit-msg`, `prepare-commit-msg` — each of which resolves the binary at run
time and dispatches into it. Nothing runs in any repository you did not do this
in.

Across many repositories at once:

```sh
amont-fleet install --root ~/Developer
amont-fleet                              # report the fleet
amont-fleet tui                          # the dashboard
```

`amont-fleet` is installed separately and on purpose: it pulls ratatui,
crossterm and serde, and keeping the two installs apart is what stops "I wanted
the dashboard" from becoming "every commit now depends on a TUI library".

### When another tool already owns the hooks

`core.hooksPath` redirects hook dispatch, and `husky` sets it. In a repository
that runs husky, git reads `.husky/_` and never looks at `.git/hooks` at all —
so an install that wrote there would produce four files git never runs, and one
that wrote to `.husky/_` would hand them to a directory husky's own `prepare`
regenerates on the next `npm install`.

Both are refused, by name:

```
✗ git dispatches hooks from /repo/.husky/_, not /repo/.git/hooks
    `core.hooksPath` is set, so husky owns the hooks here. Shims
    written to either directory would be overwritten or never run.
    Hand dispatch back first: git config --unset core.hooksPath
```

`--force` does not move it. That flag means "that file is mine to replace"; it
has never meant "write where git does not look".

This is not a blanket objection to `core.hooksPath`. A repository that
deliberately keeps its hooks in, say, `tooling/hooks` under version control has
chosen a location, not handed dispatch to something that will overwrite it, and
is installed into exactly as before. The refusal needs evidence: either the
destination belongs to a hook manager that regenerates it, or our shims are
already sitting in the repository's own hooks directory — which means amont was
installed here and something later took dispatch away.

`amont uninstall` deliberately does **not** refuse. Versions before this check
wrote shims into whatever `core.hooksPath` named, so it has to be able to reach
files that are already there.

### `--force`, and what it will not do

`amont install --force` replaces a hook the installer would otherwise
refuse:

- one that is **present but carries no marker of ours** — somebody else's hook,
  or one you wrote;
- one that is a **symlink**, where writing normally would rewrite whatever it
  points at.

Without the flag, install names every such file and writes **none** of them.
`--force` is how you say the file is yours to replace, and the output then
names what it took rather than only counting what it wrote.

Two refusals `--force` does not override:

- A **tracked** file is never written. That is source belonging to a checkout,
  and it is the guard this project got wrong twice.
- A path that is a **directory or a device** is refused whatever you pass. That
  is not "a hook that is there", it is a sign something else is going on, and
  refusing costs you one `rm`.

Neither ever deletes a hook it did not write. A `pre-commit-*` or `pre-push-*`
file in `.git/hooks` without our marker is reported and left exactly where it
is. `amont-fleet --remove-unrecognized` opts into removing them, and is
spelled that way rather than `--remove-stale` because "stale" means our own
retired shims, which are a different thing entirely.

### Everywhere, forever — a real opt-in

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/git
git clone https://github.com/fredericrous/amont.git ~/.config/git/git-templates
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.config/git/git-templates/templates
git config --global commit.template ~/.config/git/git-templates/message
```

Git copies that directory into `.git/hooks` on every `init` **and every
clone**, so from then on every repository you clone runs these hooks without
being asked again. That is the convenience, and it is worth having: you never
forget to install, and `amont-fleet` never shows you an uncovered repo.

It is also a standing grant, and worth stating in full. A cloned repository can
declare its own checks in `amont.conf`. With this key set, those
declarations are present in every repository you clone — including one you
cloned only to read — and are one `amont trust` away from running. They do
**not** run before that; see [the trust model](trust.md). But if you set this
key, trust deliberately, rather than letting installation be the moment you
decided:

```sh
amont trust          # show what this repo declares, and accept it
amont trust --show   # what is trusted here
```

Full reasoning: [index fidelity and run modes](index-fidelity-and-run-modes.md) §0.

## 3. Turn them off again

```sh
amont uninstall              # this repository
amont uninstall --binary     # …and remove the binary from ~/.local/bin
amont-fleet uninstall --root ~/Developer
```

Uninstall removes **our four shims and nothing else**. A hook you wrote
yourself is left alone and named in the output, whatever it is — a hook it
cannot even read is named too, rather than passed over in silence. `hook.skip`
and `amont.severity` are never touched, because those are your statements
about your repository, not ours.

It also takes the shims back out of the template directory, and — if
`init.templateDir` is still set — says so loudly, with the command to unset it.
Without that, an uninstall you believed had finished would leave every future
`git clone` re-installing the hooks. A template directory that is itself a
checkout of this repository is never deleted from; those files are tracked
source and belong to the checkout.

This is also why the documentation never tells you to run
`rm $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/*`. That glob deletes every hook in the
directory — including ones other tools installed and ones you wrote — in order
to remove four files that belong to us. `amont uninstall` exists precisely
so that removing our hooks never means removing yours.

For bypassing a single commit, or disabling one check without uninstalling
anything, see [opting out](opting-out.md).

## 4. Keeping it up to date

Ordinary binary updates need nothing per repository: every shim points at the
one binary, so replacing the binary reaches every repo at once.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.sh | sh
```

Re-installing is only needed when the shim **set** changes — a hook added,
removed or renamed:

```sh
cd <your-repo> && amont install        # re-bake the shims here
amont-fleet fix --root ~/Developer     # or see what the whole fleet needs
amont-fleet fix --apply --root ~/Developer
```

## Windows

Everything works, with one setup difference: there is no symlink.

The one-liner for this platform is PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericrous/amont/main/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

It writes `amont.exe` and `amont-fleet.exe` into
`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`, which is where the shims look — they try both
`amont` and `amont.exe` there, so a binary in that directory resolves
even in a shim whose path was never baked. CI runs this script on a real
Windows runner against a real published release, because a documented install
path nobody executes is one you find out about from a bug report.

To build it yourself instead — Git for Windows ships `bash` and coreutils but
not `make`:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/amont install
```

On macOS and Linux `~/.config/git/git-templates` is usually a symlink to the
checkout, so `init.templateDir` can point at a stable XDG path. Windows does
not create symlinks without Developer Mode or elevation, so point git straight
at the checkout:

```sh
git config --global init.templateDir 'C:/path/to/amont/templates'
```

Nothing else changes. The shims never need the symlink: they resolve the binary
at run time, trying `$GIT_HOOKS_BIN`, the baked path, `~/.local/bin/amont`
and `~/.local/bin/amont.exe`, then `PATH`. The installer detects the `.exe`
suffix on its own.
